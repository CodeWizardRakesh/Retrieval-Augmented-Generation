Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. These intelligent systems can perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI is categorized into two main types: narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task (like virtual assistants or recommendation systems), and general AI, which aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. Key areas of AI research include machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and robotics.
